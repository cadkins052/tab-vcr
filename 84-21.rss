				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
<p>Hi there. If you&#8217;re new here and new to the Memory Palace, please feel free to poke around in the archives.</p>
<p><a href="http://(https://apple.co/thememorypalace">New episodes</a> come out every couple of weeks and appear here on the home page.</p>
<p>There are links that&#8217;ll take you to a playlist of recommended, point-of-entry episodes called <a href="http://thememorypalace.us/where-do-i-start/">&#8220;Where do I start?&#8221;</a> Now, you can start wherever you&#8217;d like. The episodes aren&#8217;t in order. None of them are serialized. And, to be perfectly honest, if you start from episode 1, you&#8217;ll have to suffer through some spotty audio quality and some (hopefully brief) creative growing pains. So, feel free to start with that playlist. It&#8217;s ten episodes that I think do a pretty good job giving you as sense of the types of stories you&#8217;re going to hear from the Memory Palace.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a link to <a href="http://thememorypalace.us/the-met-residency/">the episodes</a> I did for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York when I was its artist in residence a couple of years back. They&#8217;re meant to be listened to at the museum (there are little plaques there and everything!), but I people tend to enjoy them anywhere, I hear.</p>
<p>Now, if you find that you enjoy the show, please do me and the show the massive favor of spreading the word. Tell a friend about it. Post on social media. Skywriting over major cities and beaches is also encouraged. And, that thing people say about rating and reviewing on iTunes? Do that thing. It helps a literally absurd amount.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to come to a live show, there&#8217;s a link to upcoming <a href="http://thememorypalace.us/events/">events</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for coming. Glad to have you here. Hope you enjoy the podcast.</p>
<p>Nate</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Memory Palace is a proud member of the Radiotopia network from PRX.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br />
* I first came the story of Ross, North Dakota, while reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Muslims-America-History-Religion-American/dp/0195367561/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1457362096&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=muslims+in+america">Muslims in America: A Short History</a>, by Edward E. Curtis.<br />
* The full WPA interview with Mary Juma (and another member of the Ross community) can be found in Curtis&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Columbia-Sourcebook-Muslims-United-States/dp/0231139578/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1457361904&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=the+columbia+sourcebook+of+muslims+in+the+united+states">The Columbia Sourcebook of Muslims in the United States</a>.<br />
* A contemporary account of the Ross community can be found <a href="http://30mosques.com/archive2010/2010/09/day-22-ross-north-dakota-a-leap-in-time/">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Music</strong><br />
*The first bit is a loop from the opening of a song called <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/permafrost/id302172931?mt=1&#038;app=music">I. Permafrost</a> by a long-defunct band called Jerseyturnpike made up of a husband/wife duo from San Francisco. Years ago, I went to their wedding in New Jersey. There was a bounce house. It was beautiful.<br />
* The piece finishes up with the on-the-nose, <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/this-is-home/id667794390?i=667794473&#038;mt=1&#038;app=music">This is Home</a>, from Joel P. West&#8217;s soundtrack to the terrific film, <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/movie/short-term-12/id721402533?mt=6">Short Term 12</a>.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of doing The Memory Palace as odd little passion/art project (which came after at least a couple of years of trying and failing to make it pay), I&#8217;m now making a go of doing these idiosyncratic, tiny history stories as my job. And it&#8217;s a weird job. And I&#8217;m delighted to find myself in the position to do it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: I&#8217;m in that position because of listeners like you. People who heard the Memory Palace and told people to listen.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve enjoyed the show over the years, if you&#8217;ve been here from the beginning, if you just heard it for the first time last week&#8211;do me a favor. Do the show a favor. Tell someone about the podcast. Send your best friend a link to the best episode. Tweet about it. Share it on Facebook. Take out a full-page ad in a Major Metropolitan newspaper. Skywriting is also a good move for summer.</p>
<p>But, if the Memory Palace has moved your or entertained you or ever made a day better, let someone know.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started the Memory Palace in late 2008. Years ago. I spent the first few years trying to find a way to make it fit into public radio. I&#8217;d worked for Marketplace. I&#8217;d worked for NPR. I&#8217;d worked at local stations. I was good at those jobs. I hoped that I could turn The Memory Palace into one of those hour-long, weekend shows that could slide in between This American Life and hour fourteen of A Prairie Home Companion. That didn&#8217;t happen. I thought maybe it could air as a regular segment on an existing radio show. I thought maybe it could have it&#8217;s own little slot after a news cast once a week like some other tiny shows. Those didn&#8217;t happened.  And after awhile, I gave up. On assuming I could make a living doing it. Not on the podcast. I loved the podcast. And, after I stopped trying to make it fit into a public-radio-shaped hole, it started to get better. It got more idiosyncratic. It got more me. And people seemed to like it. </p>
<p>In the meantime, it opened up other professional doors. So the podcast was both passion project and calling card. It was cool. It wasn&#8217;t my job. But it was cool. For a couple of years, it was a part of the Maximum Fun network and supported through donations and that helped keep things going, helped ensure that I could justify making time for it while I juggled other projects. </p>
<p>Then people started listening to podcasts. Then Serial came along and people figured out what that purple button was on their iPhones. Then there were all those &#8220;Like Serial? Try this&#8230;&#8221; articles and I was lucky enough to have the Memory Palace pop up now and then. There were suddenly a lot of people listening. It became clear, very quickly that the business was changing incredibly fast (like, it was suddenly an actual business) and, if I could find away to pull it off, I could stop juggling. I could do The Memory Palace as a full-time proposition and maybe, just maybe make a living doing it. </p>
<p>So I talked to everyone. Every remotely appropriate network. Every ad-sales specialist. I weighed every option. I explored staying independent. And I ended up at Radiotopia. I&#8217;m delighted that I have.</p>
<p>Radiotopia is a collective of many of the very best audio storytellers in the English-speaking world. That&#8217;s not promo-copy hyperbole. It is an All-Star team. I&#8217;m straight-up honored to be in their company.  </p>
<p>And you should be too. Go to <a href="http://radiotopia.fm">Radiotopia.fm</a>. Listen. Your next favorite show is right there, waiting for you to find it. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the fist time ever, the Memory Palace is going to release a whole season.  Starting on June 21st and running through Labor Day, you&#8217;ll be getting a new episode of the podcast every week for the whole summer.  Lot&#8217;s more announcements to come, but, in the meantime, I&#8217;m going to be releasing some different types of episodes to tide you over.  Some remix episodes, at least one, big blowout, interview episode.  So, mark June 21st on your calendar, stock up on sunblock, and get ready for a whole summer of The Memory Palace.</p>
<p>If you want to toss a dime in the tip jar to help out until then, I&#8217;ll send you a postcard.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Memory Palace has left the Maximum Fun network.<br />
It&#8217;s not much of a story. The Memory Palace was always a bit of an outlier within the network, in terms of tone, which made it hard to find the sorts of cross-promotional opportunities that exist within other networks. There are some other, equally boring reasons, but none of them were personal. From top to bottom, the folks at Max Fun are the best. Extraordinarily nice. Walk the walk. The real deal. It&#8217;s just time to see what else is out there.</p>
<p>So.  A FAQ:</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m a Maximum Fun subscriber. Does this mean you won&#8217;t be getting any of my Maximum Contribution?</strong><br />
Yes. But: I strongly encourage you to continue to subscribe to and support Max Fun because, quite simply, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a more righteous, for-profit company anywhere. They have a vision for supporting creative professionals that is 100% worth supporting. Throw in the fact that the work they produce is also top notch, and I&#8217;ll tell you straight: you should support Max Fun.  You should continue to subscribe. I do.</p>
<p><strong>Does this mean The Memory Palace is done?</strong><br />
Nope. There are more episodes on the way. </p>
<p><strong>Like, how many more?</strong><br />
Many. The Memory Palace will be a full-time proposition starting this summer. Just how frequently it&#8217;ll be produced is TBD, but it&#8217;s going to be a huge difference from the way things have worked up till now. I&#8217;m currently figuring out the schedule, trying to sort out how I&#8217;ll need to change the way I work so I can get more pieces out into the world without sacrificing the things that I think make the podcast itself work.</p>
<p><strong>Are you joining another network?</strong><br />
Dude, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just figuring it out now. Right now, I&#8217;m a free agent.</p>
<p><strong>Ok, whatever. Bottom line: what&#8217;s in it for me?</strong><br />
Do you like the Memory Palace?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. I mean, pretty much. It&#8217;s cool.</strong><br />
No matter how any of this shakes out, I&#8217;m committed to making more episodes. So, if you like the podcast, you should like that. Maybe there&#8217;ll be an ad up front. Maybe there&#8217;ll be a new network. But it&#8217;ll be the same show.  </p>
<p><strong>What if I want to give you money in the meantime?</strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a year or whatever ago, I got approach by some extremely nice folks at Fox Digital Studios to pitch a web-series that would use their archive of old Movietone newsreels.  I made them a pilot using a single episode from (if I remember correctly) January, 1941.  The pilot didn&#8217;t go. But, after a year or so, I&#8217;ve finally been cleared to show it to people. Thanks to the good people at <a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/">Aeon Magazine</a>.  Have a look&#8230; <a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/society/forgotten-things-a-short-film-on-the-impact-of-wwii-newsreels">here.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Q: Are you still making episodes?</strong><br />
A: Absolutely.<br />
<strong>Q: When&#8217;s the next one coming out?</strong><br />
A: Soonish.<br />
<strong>Q: But, this is just a static FAQ, so soonish is completely relative. </strong><br />
A: That&#8217;s technically not a question but, sure, it&#8217;s completely relative. Put it this way: I am always working on a new episode.  Sometimes they take forever.  Sometimes it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a lot of other things going on in my life but, more often than not, it&#8217;s just that they can take me forever. I care a lot.<br />
<strong>Q: Wouldn&#8217;t you be better off, like, professionally if they came out every other monday or whatever?</strong><br />
A: Absolutely. But I&#8217;m also pretty sure they wouldn&#8217;t be very good if they did. So, it&#8217;s kind of a wash I suppose.<br />
<strong>Q: I really wish they came out more often and on a regular schedule. That&#8217;s the way podcasts work. I know that&#8217;s not a question. I&#8217;m just saying.</strong><br />
A: Yeah. for what it&#8217;s worth, me too. But, isn&#8217;t it kind of nice that you don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s coming and then all of a sudden it&#8217;s there?  Like some band you like just dropped a new track?<br />
<strong>Q: No.</strong><br />
A: Oh. I kind of hoped you were on board with that. That&#8217;s the way I think of it anyway.<br />
<strong>Q: No. Sorry. Get back to work.</strong><br />
A: On it. Look for a new episode soonish.</p>

How it works (and doesn&#8217;t).  Why things take a long time. It gets pretty deep into the public radio weeds, at times, but, if you want to go behind the curtain, it&#8217;s as good a place (until we get the permits and insurance worked out for the guided monorail tour of the Palace interiors, anyway) as you&#8217;ll find.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Proud to report that the memory palace will be, albeit briefly, in the mix of Slate&#8217;s fine podcasts. Three episodes will roll out on three mondays here in March.  Do check out their other podcasts.  I am a particular fan of their sports talk show, Hang* Up and Listen.  If you are into that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Now, some of you have been asking what the hold up has been with the new episodes.  </p>
<p>A: Thanks for asking.<br />
B: Sorry about that.<br />
C: I&#8217;ve been spending most of my time writing much of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pawnee-Greatest-America-Leslie-Knope/dp/1401310648/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1300845749&#038;sr=8-2">this book</a>  (oddly enough).  It is due to come out in October.  It is funny.  And weirdly memory palace-y in several parts.<br />
D. More episodes soon.</p>
<p>*An earlier version of this post referred to the show as &#8220;Shut up and Listen.&#8221;  It was a mistake.  But a much better name.</p>

<p>Anyway, the podcast is still up and running, but has in fact been gummed up a bit by a couple of (paying) projects with looming deadlines.  Both of which you will likely enjoy, assuming that you like the podcast, but neither of which I can talk about at the moment. Mysterious.</p>
<p>I will keep you posted and will continue to post here on the blog and poke away on new podcast episodes.  </p>
<p>thanks<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My favorite moment in the (underrated) James Bond movie <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064757/">On Her Majesty&#8217;s Secret Service</a></em> (the one with the so-much-worse-than-Sean-Connery-it&#8217;s-bananas-but-better-in-hindsight-than-<em>Moonraker</em>-era-Roger-Moore, George Lazenby) is the scene after Bond has lost his Double O status and has to clear out his desk.*  As he&#8217;s cleaning, he comes across all of these gadgets and souvenirs&#8211;some we remember from earlier adventures, others speak to these undocumented adventures beyond what we&#8217;ve been allowed to see. It is oddly moving.</p>
<p>Anyway, cleaning out some drawers here at The Memory Palace, I came across a CD of a radio documentary I did a few years ago about the history of music programming on the radio that I hadn&#8217;t thought about in awhile.  It is no exploding pen, but some of you might like it.  Link is <a href="http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/radio/">here</a>. </p>
<p>*Yes. This is my favorite moment in the movie. Even considering the ski chase. <a href="http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/007.jpg"><img src="http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/007-232x300.jpg" alt="" title="007" width="232" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-778" srcset="http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/007-232x300.jpg 232w, http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/007.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been re-reading <em>Tender is The Night</em> and A: holds up, and B: there&#8217;s this passage from when Rosemary and Abe and Dick are walking around the WWI battlefields in France (in 1925; the book came out in 1934) that kills me. Because I am, in equal measure, both nerd and sap.<a href="http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wwi-color.jpg"><img src="http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wwi-color-221x300.jpg" alt="" title="wwi color lumiere bros" width="221" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-773" srcset="http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wwi-color-221x300.jpg 221w, http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wwi-color.jpg 378w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" /></a></p>
<p><em>âSee that little stream â we could walk to it in two minutes. It took the British a month to walk to it â a whole empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind. And another empire walked very slowly backward a few inches a day, leaving the dead like a million bloody rugs. No Europeans will ever do that again in this generation.â<br />
âWhy, theyâve only just quit over in Turkey,â said Abe. âAnd in Morocco ââ<br />
âThatâs different. This western-front business couldnât be done again, not for a long time. The young men think they could do it but they couldnât. They could fight the first Marne again but not this. This took religion and years of plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that existed between the classes. The Russians and Italians werenât any good on this front. You had to have a whole-souled sentimental equipment going back further than you could remember. You had to remember Christmas, and postcards of the Crown Prince and his fiancÃ©e, and little cafÃ©s in Valence and beer gardens in Unter den Linden and weddings at the mairie, and going to the Derby, and your grandfatherâs whiskers.â<br />
âGeneral Grant invented this kind of battle at Petersburg in sixty- five.â<br />
âNo, he didnât â he just invented mass butchery. This kind of battle was invented by Lewis Carroll and Jules Verne and whoever wrote Undine, and country deacons bowling and marraines in Marseilles and girls seduced in the back lanes of Wurtemburg and Westphalia. Why, this was a love battle â there was a century of middle-class love spent here. This was the last love battle.â<br />
âYou want to hand over this battle to D. H. Lawrence,â said Abe.<br />
âAll my beautiful lovely safe world blew itself up here with a great gust of high explosive love,â Dick mourned persistently.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They moved the river when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>A large public works project that I first saw in &#8220;someday the city will like look this&#8221; illustrations in the Providence Sunday Journal when I was boy, change the course of the Providence river. They dredged the channel.  They removed a road that covered it up (and that I&#8217;d always been told was, technically, the widest bridge in the world).  They gave it a left turn into a basin, around which they put an amphitheater, and in the center of which they put a slightly anemic fountain.  It was the kind of Big Public Works Project that is nearly impossible to get done these days without graft and corruption.</p>
<p>Luckily, this was Providence, Rhode Island, a city in whose veins graft and corruption run like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_milk">coffee milk.</a>  </p>
<p>And, truth be told, the river looks great now.  Urban renewal through aesthetic revival.  </p>
<p>Anyway, one night, between my freshman and sophomore year of college, a high school friend and I were walking around downtown, exploring the construction site.  She and I were extremely close back then.  We&#8217;re not now.  No story there.  Just the way things go.  The next morning, she and I were going drive to my ten year old Chevette across country.  It was to be a Great Adventure (and it was).  It was to be a friendship cementing experience (and it was, for awhile).  But that night when we were walking around we came upon the city&#8217;s memorial (1929, granite column, carved stone at the bottom representing the different service branches, female embodiment of Peace on top) to the 612 young Rhode Islanders who&#8217;d died fighting World War I.<br />
<a href="http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wwi-memorial.jpg"><img src="http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wwi-memorial-208x300.jpg" alt="" title="wwi memorial" width="208" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-762" srcset="http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wwi-memorial-208x300.jpg 208w, http://thememorypalace.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wwi-memorial.jpg 312w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /></a><br />
 It used to be in the middle of a roundabout in the middle of the formerly-widest bridge in the world.  That night, they were nearly finished moving it to its current location in front of the courthouse.  They had dug a trench underneath it into which, I assume, they were about to pour a new cement foundation for the memorial.</p>
<p>So my friend and I took pieces of paper and wrote messages on them to commemorate the night, and that moment in our lives and in our friendship.  Words that we wanted to live by.  And we threw those messages into the hole beneath the WWI Memorial so they would be sealed underneath forever.  So our young selves would be memorialized there too.  </p>
<p>And I have absolutely no idea what I wrote.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>the memory palace is now also a blog. It&#8217;s still a podcast.  It&#8217;s still a state of mind.  But it is also a blog in the classic sense.  You know: links, essays, videos, ephemera.  Updated relatively regularly (he says, believing it, though knowing that such ambitions often fade).  All very memory palacey.  Stories, oddities, artifacts, detritus, memories, &#038;c.  </p>
<p>Check back.  </p>
<p>Tell a friend.</p>
<p>Share.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
